## How to create apple push notification certificate

1. Open you Keychain and request for a CertificateSigningRequest(CSR):

2. Create your CSR and **save it disk**:![alt tag](https://github.com/sushmasatish/handy_apn/blob/master/docs/CSRCreation.png)
3. Open **apple developer portal**, open your app id and enable push notification:![alt tag](https://github.com/sushmasatish/handy_apn/blob/master/docs/AppleDeveloper_EnablePushNotification.png)
4. In apple developer portal, To create push notification developer certificate, Click Certificate, you will see this page, click Continue here:![alt tag](https://github.com/sushmasatish/handy_apn/blob/master/docs/AppleInstructionsOnCreatingCSR.png)
5. Now upload the CSR created in step 2:![alt tag](https://github.com/sushmasatish/handy_apn/blob/master/docs/generating_certificate.png)
6. Once generated, click on download and save the file. The saved file would be named: "aps_development.cer":![alt tag](https://github.com/sushmasatish/handy_apn/blob/master/docs/click_download.png)
7. Open the downloaded aps_development.cer file by double clicking. This would add the .cer to keychain. Now Select the **private key** and the **certificate** and right click and select ```Export 2 items```:![alt tag](https://github.com/sushmasatish/handy_apn/blob/master/docs/CerPrivatePublicKeysInKeychain.png)
8. Selecting Export 2 items, will export it as .p12 file:![alt tag](https://github.com/sushmasatish/handy_apn/blob/master/docs/ExportingPrivateKeyDevCerTogether.png)
9. Now execute the following ```openssl``` command on the ```AppDemoPrivateKeyDevCerTogether.p12```:

```sh
$ openssl pkcs12 -in AppDemoPrivateKeyDevCerTogether.p12 -out push_notification_demo_apn_dev.pem -nodes -clcerts
```
