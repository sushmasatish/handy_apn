Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

### Command Line
  The handy_apn gem provides a command-line option (```handy_apn```) to test your certificates by sending message to the device.
  
  ```sh
  $ handy_apn -h
  ```
  lists the commands available.
  
  ```sh
  $ handy_apn push "f2ecca82 b48b7a38 5b838ece 3079ee6f 29f27163 d8407c1f 01f7298c 0a74bd7c" -m "Hello world" -e production -c aps_production.pem -p
  ```
  sends the message "Hello world" to the device using the production apple push notification service using the prodution pem file.

### Rakefile
  The handy_apn gem also provides a rake task to test your certificates by sending a message to the device.
  
  ```sh
  $ vi Rakefile
  ```
  Add the following code to the Rakefile.
  ```ruby
  require "handy_apn/Rakefile"
  ```
  
  Now
  ```sh
  $ rake --tasks
  $ rake apn:send_message[apn_pem_file_path,apn_pass_phrase,device_token,should_send_message_to_apn_prod,message_text]
  ```
Note:

* apn_pem_file_path - absolute location of the file along with file name
* apn_pass_phrase - passphrase for your pem file
* device_token - should be formed of 64 alphanumeric characters and separated by space after 8 characters as shown in example below.
* should_send_message_to_apn_prod - true would send to apple's production push notification service.
* message_text - Message you want to send

To test production certificate:
```sh
$ rake apn:send_message["/Users/blah/apn_certificates/aps_development.pem","blah","eb8328c8 3f42a4dd e7eb8e96 5535b0c7 653032eb 070e54d9 c55133a6 da32c94f",false,"Hello world"]
```

## How to create apple push notification certificate

 I have referred to instructions from raywenderlich.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
